I'm Meriel, an Empirical Research Fellow at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, co-advised by William Brady ([Mind & Technology Lab](https://sites.google.com/u.northwestern.edu/mind-technology-lab){:target="_blank"}) and Tessa Charlesworth ([The Change Lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/changelab/){:target="_blank"}).

Broadly, I’m interested in moral cognition, identity formation, and collective cognition. I’m especially curious about how these processes are being shaped by sociotechnical environments. In my research, I use large-scale naturalistic social media experiments and NLP approaches to study long-term cultural and attitudinal dynamics. I enjoy using data to explore how the individual mind and society as a whole evolve together over time. 

I earned dual B.A.s in Psychology (Honors) and Neuroscience from the University of Chicago in 2023.
