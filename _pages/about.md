I'm Meriel, an Empirical Research Fellow at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, co-advised by William Brady ([Mind & Technology Lab](https://sites.google.com/u.northwestern.edu/mind-technology-lab)) and Tessa Charlesworth ([The Change Lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/changelab/)).



I earned dual B.A.s in Psychology (Honors) and Neuroscience from the University of Chicago in 2023.
