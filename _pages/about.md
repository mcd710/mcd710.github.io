I'm Meriel, an Empirical Research Fellow at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, co-advised by William Brady ([Mind & Technology Lab](https://sites.google.com/u.northwestern.edu/mind-technology-lab){:target="_blank"}) and Tessa Charlesworth ([The Change Lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/changelab/){:target="_blank"}).

My research uses computational social science methods – including large-scale naturalistic social media experiments and NLP approaches – to explore questions about polarization, bias, collective cognition, and cultural change. I'm especially interested in how we can use (big) data to understand the relationships between individual psychology, social structures, and collective outcomes, and how these dynamics unfold over time.

I earned B.A.s in Psychology and Neuroscience from the University of Chicago in 2023.
